LINEAR REGRESSION
in maths: y = mx + c

in ML parameters: y = θ1 + θ2x
- While training the model we are given :
--x: input training data (univariate – one input variable(parameter))
--y: labels to data (supervised learning)
-When training the model – it fits the best line to predict the value of y for a given value of x. The model gets the best regression fit line by finding the best θ1 and θ2 values.
--θ1: intercept
--θ2: coefficient of x
