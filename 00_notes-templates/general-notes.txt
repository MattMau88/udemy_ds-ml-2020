LINEAR REGRESSION
in maths: y = mx + c

in ML parameters: y = θ1 + θ2x
- While training the model we are given :
--x: input training data (univariate – one input variable(parameter))
--y: labels to data (supervised learning)
-When training the model – it fits the best line to predict the value of y for a given value of x. The model gets the best regression fit line by finding the best θ1 and θ2 values.
--θ1: intercept
--θ2: coefficient of x

residual = diffeence between actual value and fitted value
-> to be squared to get only positive number
-> get sum of squared residuals "Residual Sum of Squares" = number that linea regrassion is trying to minimize (to find the best possible fit for the regression)

Goodness of Fit (r^2) = Model accuracy

WORKING WITH ANACONDA & CONDA
1) Anaconda: Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment
-> good for individual use
2) Conda: Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system

"conda activate" to activate base env
-> see more details in conda cheat sheet
only when env is activated, you can lauch "anaconda-navigator" from terminal or directly 
start up jupyter notebook form terminal "jupyter terminal"
"crtl+c" in to close and shut down jupyter notebook
"conda deactivate" to deactivate current env


INTRO TO PYTHON
list = can hold items of different types
array = can only hold variables of the same types
pandas.DataFrame = a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.
series = one single column

parameter: the variable/placeholder used when defining a function
argument: the input/value passed to function when it is called 

objects in python =  attributes (->state of objects, that can be changed) & methods(-> behavior of objects)

DATA VISUALISATION
tell jupyter to export chart when downloading notebook: "%matplotlib inline"
Matplotlib styling: "plt.style.use('classic')" -> see styling options: https://tonysyu.github.io/raw_content/matplotlib-style-gallery/gallery.html
